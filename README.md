Unsupervised Machine Learning

Cryptocurrency market data was loaded and preprocessed for analysis. The data was then normalized using StandardScaler to enhance clustering performance. K-Means clustering was implemented to group cryptocurrencies based on price changes, and the optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, and the explained variance of the principal components was analyzed. Finally, scatter plots were created to visualize the clusters and compare the results from both the original data and the PCA data.

The libraries and languages used to accomplish this homework were:

1. Calinski-Harabasz Score
2. HoloViz (hvplots)
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. KMeans
5. Panda
6. PCA
7. Scikit Learn
8. Silhouette Score
9. Standard Scaler
10. Python
